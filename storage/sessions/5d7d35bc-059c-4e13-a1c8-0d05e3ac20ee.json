Narita Express goes to Tokyo Station, Shinjuku, Shibuya - less direct for Asakusa. Skyliner is faster (about 41 min to Ueno) and cheaper than NEX. Book Skyliner tickets online for a discount. With 6pm arrival, you'll clear customs by 7-7:30pm - trains run until later evening. Either works but Skyliner to Ueno then subway to Asakusa is your best route.",

Tattoos can be an issue at some places - check your ryokan's policy; many now allow them or have private baths. Bring nothing - they provide soap, shampoo, towels.

At the main hall: throw a coin (5 yen is lucky) into the offertory, bow twice, clap twice, bow once. No photography where prohibited. Remove shoes when entering buildings. Dress modestly.
