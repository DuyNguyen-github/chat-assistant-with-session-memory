      "content": "That's exciting! Japan in spring is beautiful, especially for cherry blossom season. For three weeks you can cover a lot. I'd suggest: Tokyo 5-6 days, Kyoto 5-6 days with day trips to Nara and Arashiyama, Osaka 2-3 days, Hiroshima 1-2 days with Miyajima. For rural areas, consider Takayama, Kanazawa, or the Japan Alps. The key is balancing cities with some slower-paced regions. What are your main interests - culture, food, nature, or a mix?",

For crafts: Kanazawa has gold leaf, Kyoto has textiles. For food: Tokyo and Osaka are incredible. Gluten-free is improving - carry a Japanese allergy card, many restaurants in tourist areas have options. Language: tourist areas have basic English; Google Translate works well. For accommodations: consider ryokans in Kyoto - traditional, quiet, often with kaiseki dinners. I'll factor all this into a detailed itinerary.",

JR Pass: for Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka-Hiroshima-Takayama-Tokyo, a 14-day pass likely pays off. The round-trip alone is expensive. Book Shinkansen seats in advance for cherry blossom season.",

The JR Pass covers: all JR trains including Shinkansen, JR local lines in Tokyo (Yamanote, Chuo, etc.), JR lines in Kyoto (to Nara, etc.), and most long-distance JR trains. It does NOT cover subways (Tokyo Metro, Toei, Kyoto subway) or private lines. So you'll use a mix - JR where possible, buy separate tickets for non-JR.

For Kyoto: Higashiyama if you want walkable temples and atmosphere; near Kyoto Station if you prefer convenience for day trips. Higashiyama is more atmospheric but hills; Station area is flat and central. I'd lean Higashiyama for 2-3 nights then Station for the rest if you're doing multiple day trips.

No backup if blossoms are early/late. Not making restaurant reservations for popular spots. Not carrying cash. Rushing - Japan rewards slow exploration.
